# Project Sales Forecasting

## Problem Statement

Advanced Analytics – Candidate Data Science Presentation
The purpose of this task is to demonstrate your ability to solve an analytical problem, conduct analysis, and explain to an audience the findings and results from your analysis.
- [Forecasting - “Corporación Favorita Grocery Sales Forecasting”](https://www.kaggle.com/c/favorita-grocery-sales-forecasting/overview)
- Follow the Kaggle objective to achieve an accurate model
From the Kaggle website, you can understand the context of the problem, get the data, and understand Kaggle’s performance metrics.
You are required to:
- Build a solution to the problem
- Present your findings to a combination of Technical and Business people (Data Scientists, Business Manager) for around 30-40 minutes covering
    - Brief Summary of the Problem
    - The step-by-step approach to how you came to the answer (including unsuccessful/poor performing models and how you improved them)
    - Your solution and its performance (against the Kaggle evaluation metric but also using other appropriate metrics that you deem necessary)
    - Limitations to your approach
    - How you could improve if given more time
    - How you could extend the solution to production, scoring daily for longer forecast horizon
- Answer questions on the approach and provide justification for the analytical decisions made
- Provide the code that you wrote to answer the problem (do not leverage existing code)

- You will be given around 1 week to prepare your solution. 
- Please email your presentation slides and the code prior to the interview to aa-rectrib@Coles.com.au

# Solution

This is your new Kedro project, which was generated using `Kedro 0.18.2`.

Take a look at the [Kedro documentation](https://kedro.readthedocs.io) to get started.

## Rules and guidelines

In order to get the best out of the template:

* Don't remove any lines from the `.gitignore` file we provide
* Make sure your results can be reproduced by following a [data engineering convention](https://kedro.readthedocs.io/en/stable/faq/faq.html#what-is-data-engineering-convention)
* Don't commit data to your repository
* Don't commit any credentials or your local configuration to your repository. Keep all your credentials and local configuration in `conf/local/`

## How to install dependencies

Declare any dependencies in `src/requirements.txt` for `pip` installation and `src/environment.yml` for `conda` installation.

To install them, run:

```
pip install -r src/requirements.txt
```

## How to run your Kedro pipeline

You can run your Kedro project with:

```
kedro run
```

## How to test your Kedro project

Have a look at the file `src/tests/test_run.py` for instructions on how to write your tests. You can run your tests as follows:

```
kedro test
```

To configure the coverage threshold, go to the `.coveragerc` file.

## Project dependencies

To generate or update the dependency requirements for your project:

```
kedro build-reqs
```

This will `pip-compile` the contents of `src/requirements.txt` into a new file `src/requirements.lock`. You can see the output of the resolution by opening `src/requirements.lock`.

After this, if you'd like to update your project requirements, please update `src/requirements.txt` and re-run `kedro build-reqs`.

## How to work with Kedro and notebooks

> Note: Using `kedro jupyter` or `kedro ipython` to run your notebook provides these variables in scope: `context`, `catalog`, and `startup_error`.
>
> Jupyter, JupyterLab, and IPython are already included in the project requirements by default, so once you have run `pip install -r src/requirements.txt` you will not need to take any extra steps before you use them.

### Jupyter
To use Jupyter notebooks in your Kedro project, you need to install Jupyter:

```
pip install jupyter
```

After installing Jupyter, you can start a local notebook server:

```
kedro jupyter notebook
```

### JupyterLab
To use JupyterLab, you need to install it:

```
pip install jupyterlab
```

You can also start JupyterLab:

```
kedro jupyter lab
```

### IPython
And if you want to run an IPython session:

```
kedro ipython
```

### How to convert notebook cells to nodes in a Kedro project
You can move notebook code over into a Kedro project structure using a mixture of [cell tagging](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/changelog.html#release-5-0-0) and Kedro CLI commands.

By adding the `node` tag to a cell and running the command below, the cell's source code will be copied over to a Python file within `src/<package_name>/nodes/`:

```
kedro jupyter convert <filepath_to_my_notebook>
```
> *Note:* The name of the Python file matches the name of the original notebook.

Alternatively, you may want to transform all your notebooks in one go. Run the following command to convert all notebook files found in the project root directory and under any of its sub-folders:

```
kedro jupyter convert --all
```

### How to ignore notebook output cells in `git`
To automatically strip out all output cell contents before committing to `git`, you can run `kedro activate-nbstripout`. This will add a hook in `.git/config` which will run `nbstripout` before anything is committed to `git`.

> *Note:* Your output cells will be retained locally.
